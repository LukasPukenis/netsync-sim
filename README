# Intro
This is a crude network simulator in order to observe how batching could help improve battery life.
It draws on assumptions that emitting more data at once is more optimal than emitting less data
throrough the time.

# limitations
- [] Time is simulated assuming seconds. This means emulator can't emulate latency properly
as it's in milliseconds. Multiplying values by 1,000 introduces speed issues.
- [] On-Receive batching does not function well.
- [] No ability to postpone signal creation at a later time to show the effects of autocalibration.
